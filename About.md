## Fisheries sandbox
The Fishery Sandbox is a platform for simulating real-world fisheries and performing cost-benefit analyses for competing management strategies.  It is designed to accept as much or as little information as is available and will be able to test the simplest of management interventions (e.g. spatial closures) to more complex measures, such as age-structured stock assessments. For more details on the underlying dynamics of the simulation framework, see <http://www.reddit.com>.

### Spatial extent
-
Enter the latitude and longitude of the fishery, zoom to desired level, click to define fishery extent.

### Life history
-
Defines growth, weight, movement, habitat, if available. Insert method to scrape from fishbase if there is no data, given a species name.

### Fleet dynamics
-
Defines the characteristics of the current fishing.

### Scenarios
-
Allow for the specification of MPAs, size limits, seasons, etc.

### Output
-
Plots of biomass, profit, costs, yield,

### Fishery patterns
